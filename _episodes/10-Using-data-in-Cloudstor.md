# Using data in CloudStor

Make sure you are working in Jupyter Notebooks with the Python kernel running. We are going to use a software library called 'pandas', written for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

- In a code cell type 

`import pandas`

- Execute the cell.

- In a new code cell type

`pandas.read_csv ("")`

and place this public link to the data saved in CloudStor between the quotes:  https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/x2uHIEZubsNuqEh/download

### Activity

Upload your own data set into Cloudstor. Create a public link and and repeat the above instructions again, using the new link.
